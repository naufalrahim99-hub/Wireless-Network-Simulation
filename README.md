# Wireless-Network-Simulation
A complete wireless simulation to simulate signal strength, channel interference and signal to noise ratio for a client using ekahau tool

<h1>Tools</h1>
<p>For our simulation, we will be using Ekahau as our medium to simulate and plan our wireless simulation</p>

<h1>Planning Phase </h1>
<p>1st thing we need to begin before planning our simulations is a floor plan</p>
<p>Below we have a floor plan of school for 1st floor. The Grey area will be our main focus for the simulation testing</p>
<p>the Circle with the dot in the middle will be the placement of access point for our simulation</p>
<p>We will be using a standard wifi 6 Generic Access Point for this simulation</p>
